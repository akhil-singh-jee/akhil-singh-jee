### 🧠 Who I Am

I am a **college-level developer** with hands-on experience in **AI/ML and drone-related projects**. I have learned and worked through **projects, internships, and freelance work**, focusing on practical implementation rather than theory alone.

My interest lies in building and understanding how **AI models, embedded systems, and drones** work together in real applications.

🔍 Areas I have worked in:
- **UAV & Drone Systems** (basic firmware, sensors, workflows)
- **AI & Machine Learning projects** (learning-based, project-level)
- **Computer Vision** for detection and analysis
- **Embedded Systems & IoT** for automation use cases  
- Additional exposure to **frontend development** for project interfaces

⚙️ I enjoy experimenting, learning by building, and improving my skills step by step through real work.
