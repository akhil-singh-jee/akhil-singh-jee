## About

I work in the **AI/ML and UAV (drone) domain**, with hands-on experience in **autonomous drone systems, embedded firmware, and AI-driven perception**.

My primary exposure and project work include:
- AI/ML concepts applied to real-world systems  
- Computer vision for real-time detection and analysis  
- Drone firmware and UAV system integration  
- Embedded systems for robotics and automation use cases  

I have contributed to and worked on **AI-enabled drones**, combining **machine learning models with embedded hardware** to build practical, deployable solutions. My focus is on learning deeply, experimenting rigorously, and applying AI where it creates measurable impact in robotics and aerial systems.

I am continuously building skills toward advanced roles and research opportunities in **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Robotics Engineering**, with a strong interest in intelligent autonomous systems.
